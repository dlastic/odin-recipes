# Recipe Page Project

This is the first project from The Odin Project curriculum, where the goal is to create a simple webpage showcasing three different recipes. The project involves building a basic `index.html` page that links to individual pages for each recipe.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, the following skills will be developed:

- **Basic HTML structure**: Creating and structuring an HTML page with essential elements like headers, paragraphs, and lists.
- **Links and navigation**: Adding hyperlinks to navigate between the main page (`index.html`) and individual recipe pages.
- **Content organization**: Using HTML to present information clearly and accessibly.
  
This project serves as an introduction to web development, focusing on fundamental concepts such as HTML syntax and creating simple, user-friendly webpages.

## Project Goals

- Create an `index.html` page with a list of three recipes.
- Each recipe should link to its own separate page (using basic hyperlinks).
- Use HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and lists to organize the content.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of the page and linking content.

This project is designed to give a solid foundation in HTML and prepare for more advanced web development projects in the Odin Project curriculum.
